MODEL
- MODELS manage the data for an application
- NOT concerned with user-interface nor presentation layers
- REPRESENT unique forms of data that applicaitonmay reuire
- upon CHANGE or UPDATED - notify its observers (in this case Views)
- GOOD EXAMPLE to use to explain is a PHOTO GALLERY APPLICATION
    - a photo would merit its own MODEL as it represents a unique kind of domain-specific data. the MODEL may contain related attributes - ie. caption, image source, and additional meta-data. a specific photo would be stored in an instance of a model and a model may also be reusable.
