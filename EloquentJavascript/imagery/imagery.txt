Chapt 4. Error Handling

1) Kevin Bacon grabs a sac and thows it on the car object next to it. Represents OOP programming - which is chapt 6
2) KB looks at a program and shows that it is wrong - inside undefined words - PROGRAMMING MISTAKES - UNDEFINED VARIABLES - EXTENT OF ERROR HANDLING.
3) KB -then looks at his watch. Watch jumps off of his wrist - and runs away. RUNTIME ERRORS
4) bee with a slice of pizza - stings the watch BETWEEEN (USES SLICE METHOD); 
5) Bee and watch start throwing and catching a the prescious - chinese budda guy in the background - field pops up with yellow flowers and 1 red one - EXCPETION HANDLING; THROW; TRY; CATCH; SPECIAL VALUES; LASTELEMENT FUNCTION 
6) The watch mows the field - until the finish line - runs into pile of e sacks (the ones KB was throwing) with an E on it - stubs its watch toe CLEANING UP EXCEPTIONS;  FINALLY KEYWORD; ERROR OBJECTS;
7)Climbs on the sacks and sits looks at the field of flowers on the the other side of sacks - after the finish line and selects areas to clean up. red flowers. In the middle of the field i boy with blinde hair sits at his desk filling in a scantron.  UNHANDLED EXCPETIONS; SELECTIVE EXCEPTION HANDLING; AUTOMATED TESTING 



Chapt 5 Functional Programming

1) Recluse walks from backhoe with a banana in his hand and Jumps up in the air - and hits the tiles of a vertical leap jumper - with a big 4 on the top. HIGH ORDER FUNCTIONS; FOREACH FUNCTION; 
2)Recluse walks by a Magician - who is playing the board game operation and then pulls a guy with a part out of his hat; OPERATIONS INTERFACE; PARTIAL FUNCTION.
3)He then walks futher down - to where a woman is handing out star maps - siting on a chair. MAP FUNCTION OR ARRAY METHOD - MAP(PROCESSPARAGRAPH,RECLUSEFILE.SPLIT("\N\N"))
4)He takes a file and hits it with a banana - SPLIT METHOD ON RECULSE FILE -
5) The pieces start going down a conveyor belt - guy in the background heads a ball and misses the goal - HEADER =0
