javascript
==========

JavaScript code I am storing for reference. Ie. higher order functions; and other useful functions and code

A couple of notes: 

1. JavaScript is primarilly is regarded as a functional programming language. Which taken from the Haskell page from wikipedia - means the function is primary control construct.
